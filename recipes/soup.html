      <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        Combine tomatoes, chicken broth, garlic cloves, and a large slice of
        onion in a stockpot over medium heat. Bring to a boil, and gently simmer
        for about 15 to 20 minutes to blend flavors.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove from heat and run the mixture through a food mill into a large
        bowl, or pan. Discard any stuff left over in the food mill.
      </li>
      <li>
        Melt butter over medium heat in the now empty stockpot. Stir in flour to
        make a roux by cooking, whisking constantly, until mixture turns medium
        brown.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gradually whisk in a bit of the tomato mixture to prevent lumps from
        forming, then stir in the rest.
      </li>
      <li>Season with sugar and salt to taste.</li>
      <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
